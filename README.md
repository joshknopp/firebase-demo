# Firebase Demo

This is intended as a reference implementation for a simple Angular + Nitric + Firebase auth app. It will contain just enough code to spin up a simple app that allows user registration and login with at least one example of a protected route and a protected function.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository and perform `npm install` from both `api` and `client` folders. If running in VS Code, go to the "Run and Debug" view (`Ctrl+Shift+D`) and run the profile called "Server/Client". This will start the Nitric server and open its API Explorer in your browser, and will also start the Angular app and open in a separate browser.
